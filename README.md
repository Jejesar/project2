# Project 2
As part of my studies in industrial IT at HELHa, we had to carry out a project involving counting the number of blocks passing on a conveyor belt.

Each group had a different characteristic to measure and display on a website as well as on an LCD screen.

## Primary components we used
**[Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/)** :
*Used for database, web server, api.*

**[Arduino Mega](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/mega-2560)** :
*Used to read to sensors' informations and send it to the Rasberry.*

**[TOF10120](https://www.electroniclinic.com/tof10120-laser-rangefinder-arduino-display-interfacing-code/)** :
*Laser distance sensor used to measure the depth of the hole in a brick.*

**[IR-OBST](https://www.velleman.eu/products/view/?id=439196)** :
*Infrared sensor used to detect if a brick is under the laser sensor.*

## Services we used
**Express JS** :
*Framework for building web applications based on Node.js*

**Twig** :
*Modern template engine for web applications*

**MySQL** :
*Relational database management system*

**Bootstrap** :
*Front-end development framework for the creation of websites and web apps*

**ChartJS** :
*Simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library for the modern web*
